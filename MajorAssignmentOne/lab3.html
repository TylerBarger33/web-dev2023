      At the end of the 1800s the technology to reproduce sounds were developing at a rapid rate. Thomas Edison invented the phonograph, which used a metal cylinder, 
      in 1877, and later gramophones were ushered in to take on the developing vinyl disc. The first commercially sold recording was from 1902, but they weren't widely popular.
      While the first commercial recordings were introduced in this decade, more commonly sheet music was purchased and performed by friends and family in the household livingroom on
      the piano. The first blues and jazz recordings are also traced back to this decade mostly Vaudville in style, but the predominant genre was ragtime, the likes of Scott Joplin, Bert Williams, and 
      George Walker were some of the most successful composers in the early 1900s. This decade proved that the market capability of recordings were promising, and led to companies 
      investing into marketing and researching making higher quality products.

      Although the apparatuses for recording were becoming slightly easier to access, all recordings were still done acoustically, meaning soundwaves were mechanically vibrating
      a needle to etch a path into the reproduction medium, no microphones or amplifications were avaliable yet. This led to many problems in quality, but musicians and engineers 
      worked together to make the best of what they had. Forms of blues and big band jazz were growing in popularity in this decade, W. C. Handy's 'St. Louis Blues', and The Original Dixieland
      Band's "Livery Stable Blues" as well as "Tiger Rag" out of New Orleans are firmly placed as the first true commercial jazz releases. World War I was raging through this and many
      marches and styles of military music were recorded as well, the Hellfighters Marching Band were made up of entirely military men and sang about war experiences.

       The 20's gave way to an economic boom all across the world following the end of World War I. This era, called the Roarin' 20s or the Jazz Age, brought radio to many households
       as well as higher quality vinyl recordings. The advent of the microphone allowed for softly sung vocals to be recorded alongside a standard band. Many notable figures came out 
       of this era, ones that have remained relevant even 100 years later, such as Louis Armstrong, George Gershwin, Duke Ellington, and Jelly Roll Morton. This shifted the jazz stylings
       out of New Orleans and onto the international scene. Meanwhile, southern folk music was beginning to form what would be known as Country music. The era skyrocketed the avaliable
       number of recordings and free access to music through radio. Ideas were being transferred over long distances and replicated by other players.

        The Swing era came full force following the great depression, this fun and danceable genre helped brighten the world following the devastaion of the economic fall.
        Bing Crosby, Benny Goodman, Ella Fitzgerald, Count Basie, and Frank Sinatra are some of the most famous jazz artists in the world, all coming from Swing. Film was also 
        making leaps in production, which gave way to film soundtracks and musicals, Irving Berlin and Ethel Waters were featured in musical films. Roy Acuff came into the limelight
        as the "King of Country", Johnny Cash, and other country artists were breaking into the scene as well. Robert Johnson's "Crossroads Blues" also took off in the delta blues
        genre. The electrical revolution in music was helping to make radios present in the home of every american family, access to a few different styles of music became easy for
        most people to hear more than just your families sheet music and what recordings are avaliable. Dance clubs and music venues/environments were growing in popularity as well.

      <p>The music of the 40s was a natural extension of the 30s. Swing music was becoming more complex, and bebop was starting to emerge, more solos and flashy playing was coming from
        players such as John Coltrane, Charlie Parker, Dizzy Gillespie, and Thelonious Monk. Artists like Nat King Cole were bringing smooth sounds with artists like Frank Sinatra, and Bing Crosby
        making huge moves in their continuing careers. The Ink Spots were making popular hits that were giving way to styles that would evolve into Doo-wop. Rhythm and Blues, which would
        give way to Rock n Roll, was growing to a massive level. Western music and cowboy culture was emerging through film, and country was making huge moves into the charts, Roy Rodgers and Hank 
        Williams are a few of the biggest.

        The 1950s saw a similar boom in economics to the 20s, following World War II people were happy to engage with radical cultural movements, Rock n Roll and Rockabilly
        were in full swing, Chuck Berry, Elvis Presley, Little Richard, Buddy Holly, and Roy Orbison were leading the way for the masses to engage in rebellious art and behavior. Jazz continued
        to get more and more complex while removing mass appeal in many ways, the end result was a generational divide unlike almost any other decade of music. Jazz wasn't like old jazz, 
        and the kids were into all kinds of weird trends, the older generation now had a choice to listen to their old records and stations while the youth could adopt their own new culture.
        This was the perfect storm for what came in the 60s.

      The British invasion is a term for the era of rock music led by acts like The Beatles, The Rolling Stones, The Who, The Yardbirds, and many many others. The early years followed very
      much in the vein of 50s rock, but with a new anti-war rebellious twist that would lead to the hippie movements in the second half of the decade. Psychedelics started playing a new 
      role in artistic expression, widening more of the generational gap that formed earlier in the 50s. New technology in instruments were allowing experiementation in ways that no one had thought possible. 
      Recordings in multiple layers had become normal, allowing for better takes and overdubs as well as adding different audio effects. Things like backmasking, reverb, and differents new 
      sounds were at everyone's fingertips along with stereophonic recordings that allowed 2 different channels to be stored on a single record. All these developments made music a much larger 
      industry than it had ever been, creating pop sensations overnight, and bringing live performances to televisions in real time.

          The 70s saw some dramtic changes, rock had become the norm, artists like Fleetwood Mac, Pink Floyd, Led Zeppelin, and Van Halen were taking over the airwaves. The amount of 
          innovation in music distribution allowed for many different styles to flourish at once, folk, country, blues, and jazz, were all in healthy spots in their own communities, and money
          and record deals were plenty. Other styles such as electronic and disco were beginning to form as well, taking beats from old RnB albums and reworking them on synthesizers, as well
          as playing with different rock elements made the craze turn into a full blown cultural movement. In the background niche styles were beginning to take root that fed into a much smaller
          but still very active fanbase with loud guitars and fast tempos, while hard rock groups like AC/DC and Led Zeppelin were harder and louder than normal rock, bands like Black Sabbath, Iron Maiden, and Judas
          Priest were trailblazing a heavier sound that would cause a major rift in rock as a genre, which turned into a new category called metal. Punk also was feeding these fans with artists
          like the Sex Pistols, the Ramones, and the Misfits.

        Sounds in the 80s started spreading in every direction digital recording allowed more artists to come into the scene CDs allowed for an almost perfect recreation of sound without the 
        annoyance of tapes. Hard rock turned more commercial with glam rock, electronic music started taking over the normal pop instrumentation, and heavy music
        was growing slowly in the underground, subgenres like thrash, speed, death, doom, and black metal all mark starting points in the 80s. Artists like Micheal Jackson, 
        pioneered things that would be called synth-pop, as well as smooth jazz showing relevance with Kenny G. The 80s had a wide market that was willing to take on all kinds of challenging styles
        leaving almost no genre that originated in the 60s or 70s without widely expanding on it. This decade is where we find the beginning of the modern digital pop concept, and even the start of
        hip-hop managed to happen here.

        Grunge, Britpop, Industrial rock, Indie, Groove Metal, Hardcore Punk, all took control in the 90s, Nirvana, Alice in Chains, Pearl Jam, and Rob Zombie took everything to another level. 
        The dirty sounds of grunge mixed together heavy guitars of metal with the attitude of punk, and had many larger than life celebrities that gave the movement figureheads that the world 
        could follow in amazement. 
        Pop artists such as Mariah Carey, Sheryl Crow, Dido, and Sarah McLachlan, Backstreet Boys, NSYNC, 98 Degrees, Hanson, Christina Aguilera, Britney Spears, Jessica Simpson, Mandy Moore, 
        Jennifer Lopez and Destiny's Child were seeing massive success as well. Taking many electronic elements and synthesizers to the studio to craft a new sound with drum machines. 
        Hip-hop's rise to power started here as well, Dr. Dre, Eminem, Mobb Deep, Wu-Tang Clan, NWA, Biggie Smalls, Tu-pac all garnered huge audiences in the media and streets alike.
        Leading to a domination of the charts that is still holding on to this day.
