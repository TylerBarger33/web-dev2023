                The world of fantasy writing was most mostly centered on children's stories prior to the 
                1900s, with rare exceptions. Stories like "A Christmas Carol" while focused on appeal to children were popular nonetheless. 
                Horror stories were somewhat of an outlier but the likes
                of H.P Lovecraft, Oscar Wilde, and H.G Wells moved the genre significantly in the early 1900s as well.
                Considered the first adult fantasy author, a Scottsman, Geogre MacDonald, wrote the story of "A Dish of Orts" in 1893.
                Some attribute the new approach to writing to the secular arts movements and the ability to write freely of the influence of the church.
                Other popular novels from this time include "Alice in Wonderland", "The Wonderful Wizard of Oz", and "The Call of Cthulhu". Many of these tales weren't set in 
                an expanded fully realized world, but inside of an iteration of the current Earth. The stories were mostly focused on the characters and their experiences within 
                their social circles and the people they interacted with. The concepts of creating a new universe and exploring unknown species and languages hadn't really been 
                used or popularized until later.

        <p>Tolkien is the Godfather of modern fantasy. His work in "The Hobbit" and "The Lord of the Rings" changed the conventions of the Fantasy genre entirely. His work is termed
            High Fantasy, these works are associated with an alternative world or universe that has elements of mystical or magical abilities and a typical good versus evil plot structure.
             while many fantasy stories had been written before J.R.R Tolkien's time, he became the quintessential author, blowing the genre to the forefront of fiction writings. 
             "The Lord of the Rings" became vastly popular throughout the 60s in the U.S. and led to many references across popular culture. Part of the high fantasy world he created included 
             many crafted languages that were created by Tolkien for the use of the different races of creatures in his world. His position as a professor of Anglo-Saxon at Cambridge allowed 
             him to devote time into fleshing out several working languages, and even set the standards for how words would be spelled in English later on. His influence is felt massively to this 
             day in the forms of films, table-top games, video games, and books alike. After his passing his works would be compiled by his son, and released in accordance with his estate, allowing
             fans and scholars insights into the rest of what the worlds had to offer and his insights on other myths in our universe as well.

            The advent of the Lord of the Rings made the world wake up to the allure of fantasy writing, and following in his footsteps became inevitable. George R. R. Martin with his A Song of ice and Fire,
           series, Robert Jordan with The Wheel of Time series, Andrzej Sapkowski with The Witcher series, Frank Herbert with Dune. All these massive worlds were created with a huge amount 
           of influence from J.R.R. Tolkien, and were brought to the public when they were very hungry for more writings of high fantasy. These worlds turned into massively successful intellectual
           properties, with video games, movies, TV series, comic books, audiobooks, podcasts, and dedicated fans that are willing to write and commit hundreds or thousands of hours into learning about
           the fictional worlds created. The famous game of Dungeons and Dragons borrows heavily from many of these works, and allows a participant to enter a new world and escape the 
           limited universe we live in. They opened the idea of fantasy to the mainstream once again with the show Game of Thrones taking the world by storm, and moving George R.R. Martin to the 
           top of the bestsellers lists again and again, with every release. leaving a lengendary piece of work behind nearly 70 years ago, J.R.R. Tolkien changed the world of fantasy and entertainment
           forever, making the landscape for game development and writing ripe with passion and ambition. And that legacy will last for hundreds of years.
